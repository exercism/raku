# Flatten Array

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

## Resources

Remember to check out the Perl 6 [documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/) and
[resources](https://perl6.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension `.t`) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension `.pm6`).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command `perl6 --doc *.t` (\* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
`prove . --exec=perl6` in the exercise directory.
You can also add the `-v` flag e.g. `prove . --exec=perl6 -v` to display all
tests, including any optional tests marked as 'TODO'.
