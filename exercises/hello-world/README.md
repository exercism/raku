# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Resources

Remember to check out the Perl 6 [documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/) and
[resources](https://perl6.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension `.t`) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension `.pm6`).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command `perl6 --doc *.t` (\* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
`prove . --exec=perl6` in the exercise directory.
You can also add the `-v` flag e.g. `prove . --exec=perl6 -v` to display all
tests, including any optional tests marked as 'TODO'.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
