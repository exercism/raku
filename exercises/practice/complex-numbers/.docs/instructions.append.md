## Custom operators

Raku has builtin support for [complex][Complex numbers], so this exercise focuses more on creating [custom][custom operators].
Operators are classifed by their position relative to their operand(s).
There are four types in this exercise, namely:

* Prefix (before)
* Infix (inbetween)
* Circumfix (surrounding), and
* Postfix (after)
