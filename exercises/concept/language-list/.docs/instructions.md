# Instructions

You're going to write some code to manage a list of programming languages to learn.

## 1. Add a language to a list

Modify the `add-language` subroutine, which takes a list of languages and a language name as arguments, to return a list with the new language appended to the end.

## 2. Remove a language from a list

Modify the `remove-language` subroutine to remove the last language from a given list.

## 3. Fetch the first language from a list

Modify the `first-language` subroutine to return the first language from a given list.

## 4. Fetch the last language from a list

Modify the `last-language` subroutine to return the last language from a given list.

## 5. Fetch a slice of languages from a list

Modify the `get-languages` subroutine, which takes a list of languages and a list of numbers for wanted elements, to return a slice of the given list.

## 6. Check if a language exists in a list

Modify the `has-language` subroutine, which takes a language list and a language name as arguments, to return either `True` or `False` indicating if the language exists in the given list.
