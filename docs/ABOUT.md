# About

It may be difficult to find a programming language that is more expressive. [Raku](https://raku.org/) is a modern, multi-paradigm language. Raku offers [procedural](https://docs.raku.org/language/functions), [object-oriented](https://docs.raku.org/language/objects) and [functional programming](https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#Functions_are_first-class_objects) methodologies.

[Curious?](https://raku.org/) Dig deeper in the [documentation](https://docs.raku.org/) or the module [repository](https://raku.land/) (like pypi or CPAN).

It is a supremely [flexible](https://docs.raku.org/language/operators) language, [adapting](https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#gradual_typing) to your style of programming, whether that be quick [one­liners](https://docs.raku.org/language/create-cli) for sysadmins, scripts to manage a database import, or the full stack of modules necessary to realise an [entire website](https://cro.services/).

Raku learns from other languages:

* It enhances Perl’s long­term appeal with a proper object system including [roles](https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#role), [threading](https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency) and [multi­method](https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#Multi-dispatch) dispatch.
* It's taking threading from Java - [simplified](https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency) to a handful of methods.
* Using [foreign-function](https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall) interfaces from Lisp makes accessing libraries as simple as one line of code.
* [Regular expressions](https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes) are now turned up to 11 - with the introduction of Parser Expression [Grammars](https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars), which let you tackle huge parsing tasks.
* Strictures and warnings are now automatic, cutting out huge swathes of potential errors.
* ... and it knows how to do [math](https://docs.raku.org/language/math): ```1/10 * 3 == 0.3 ``` - try that in your favorite language!

Raku’s mottos:
* "Raku is designed to make the easy jobs easy, without making the hard jobs impossible."
* "There Is More Than One Way To Do It - now with even more -Ofun (optimized for fun) added."
